# Function Labs #

## Question 1: SumNumber.js ##

*Write a program that requests from the user two numbers. The program is required to calculate the sum of the two numbers received from the user and display the output to the user. The sum must be calculated by creating a function called sum which receives two arguments, calculates the sum of the two values and returns the answer to the calling function.*

## Question 2: NumSqr.js ##

*Write a program to calculate the square of a number. The square must be calculated by creating a function called sqr which receives the appropriate parameters, calculates the square of the number and returns it to the calling function.*

## Question 3: NumCube.js   ##
*Write a program to calculate the cube of a number. The square must be calculated by creating a function called cube which receives the appropriate parameters, calculates the cube of the number and returns it to the calling function.*

## Question 4: AreaCircle.js ##

*Write a program that calculates an Area of a circle. The area of the circle must be calculated by creating a function called areaCircle which receives the appropriate arguments, calculates the area and returns it to the calling function.d*

## Question 5: SimpleCalculator.js ##

*Write a program that will read two numbers and an integer code from the keyboard. The value of the integer code should be 1, 2, 3 or 4. If the value of the code is 1, compute the sum of the two numbers. If the code is 2, compute the difference (first minus second). If the code is 3, compute the product of the two numbers. If the code is 4, and the second number is not zero, compute the quotient (first divided by the second). If the code is not equal to 1, 2, 3 or 4, display an error message. The program is then to display the two numbers, the integer code and the computed result to the screen*

## Question 6: WeightCost.js ##

*Design a program that will receive the weight of a parcel and determine the delivery charge for that parcel. Charges are calculated as follows:*

### Parcel Weight (kg) Cost per kg ($) ###
-   <2.5 kg  $3.50 per kg
-   2.5â€“5 kg $2.85 per kg
-   >5-7 kg  $2.45 per kg
-   >7       $3.25 per kg


*Your program must include a function/functions that will calculate the cost of the Parcel and return the cost to the calling function.*

## Question 7: isEven.js ##

*Write a program that requests from the user an integer value. The program is required to determine if the value entered by the user is an even or odd number. Write a function isEven which accepts the integer values and returns true if the integer value is even and false if the value is odd.*

## Question 8: isOdd.js ##

*Write an odd calculator program that will display all the odd numbers between a specified range. The program should prompt the user for a start number to indicate the start of the range and an end number to indicate the end of the range. Write a function isOdd which, given an integer value, returns 1 if the number is odd, 2 if the number is even and 0 if the number is a zero.*

## Question 9: OddAverage.js ##

*Write a program to read 6 numbers and find the average of all odd numbers. Your program must calculate and print the average of all the odd numbers.*
